# ContentCleavage

See the split between comments and primary content.

## Introduction

ContentCleavage is an extension for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox (written 
as a Greasemonkey user script) that improves web page readability by providing
additional visual cues regarding page structure.

When comments can be detected in a page, ContentCleavage inserts a narrow bar
along the right side of the browser window. The bar is color-coded to indicate
the proprtions of vertical space consumed by primary content and by the 
following reader comments.

## Installation

For Google Chrome:
  1. Visit http://bit.ly/commentcleavage
  2. When prompted, press 'Continue' to complete the installation.

For Mozilla Firefox:
  1. If you don't already have the Greasemonkey extension, install it from
     https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/748
  2. Visit http://bit.ly/commentcleavage
  3. Click the pop-up install button, or in the menu bar select 
     Tools > Greasemonkey > Install User Script...
  4. Ensure that Greasemonkey is activated (the monkey icon in the bottom right
     of the browser window should be shown in color and in the Greasemonkey
     menu, 'Enabled' should have a tick next to it).

Repeating the installation will update you to the latest version. However, be
aware that the Chrome Extensions tab will always show version 1.0.
